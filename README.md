# JS-Grocery-List
Simple grocery list to add items and delete items. 

Works like todo list, except local storage API is added to store values added into the list locally on the browser. 
Also user will be alerted for a few seconds when he adds a new item or if he tries to submit an empty value.
Added current date to display the date.
